- Prometheus Client
- Docker
- pytest for testing
- Black for formatting
- pylint for code quality

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- AWS account (for cloud features)

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulcyi/cloudops-automation-toolkit.git
cd cloudops-automation-toolkit
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/MacOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install required packages
```bash
python3 -m pip install pytest psutil
# or for all dependencies:
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Development

### Development Environment

#### Daily Workflow
1. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/MacOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

2. Work on your feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

4. Before committing:
   - Run all tests
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Follow commit message convention: type(scope): description

5. When finished, deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

### Development Standards

#### Git Workflow
- Main branch: Production-ready code
- Develop branch: Integration branch
- Feature branches: Format `feature/component-name`
- Current active branch: `feature/system-monitor-tests`
- Commits: Use conventional commits format

Example commit:
```
feat(monitoring): implement system metrics collection

- Add CPU, memory, and disk metrics
- Configure Prometheus integration
- Add unit tests
```

#### Testing
- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain >80% test coverage
- Run full test suite before commits

#### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints
- Document all functions and classes
- Use Black for formatting
- Use pylint for code quality

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
black .
# Check code quality
pylint src/
```

## Next Steps
1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
2. Add Docker containerization
3. Create Kubernetes deployment manifests
4. Implement infrastructure as code (Terraform/CloudFormation)
5. Add security scanning and compliance checks
